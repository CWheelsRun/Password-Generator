# Password Generator
## Website Foundation
The HTML & CSS did not need modifying, the main goal was to apply proper JavaScript functionality that opened dialogues to generate a password for the user.
## Proper Criteria
* Length of 8-128 characters chosen by user
* At least one of four types of characters:
    * Uppercase Letters
    * Lowercase Letters
    * Numbers
    * Symbols / Special Characters
## Testing Criteria
"If" statements needed to be established that would alert the user if the criteria wasn't met properly.
## The End Goal
Once criteria had been met, a password needed to be generated and output to the user that met the criteria they established.
